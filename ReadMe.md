# Plant-Disease-Detection-System

## Overview
The **Plant Disease Detection System** is a machine learning-based application that identifies plant diseases using leaf images. It utilizes deep learning models like CNNs (e.g., ResNet or DenseNet) to classify plant diseases and provide treatment recommendations, aiding farmers and gardeners in early intervention.

## Features
- **Image-Based Detection:** Upload an image of a plant leaf to detect diseases.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Uses deep learning (CNNs) for classification.
- **Fast and Accurate Results:** Provides quick and reliable disease identification.
- **Treatment Recommendations:** Offers insights into disease symptoms and potential remedies.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Available as a mobile app or web application.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python, Flask/FastAPI
- **Frontend:** React.js / HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
- **Deployment:** AWS / Firebase / Local Server

## Installation
